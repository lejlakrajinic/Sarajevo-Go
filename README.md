# Sarajevo-Go

Executive summary

Many people enjoy capturing the visual, historical, and experiential contexts that landmarks offer as they travel around the world. These individuals, however, use disjoint resources to plan trips, reducing the quality of the narrative experience they receive when visiting a place. To facilitate the description of a place and create a shared experience of that place, i will create a website which allows users to explore basic facts, photographs, historical details, and travelers’ experiences regarding Sarajevo Heritage and Cultural Sites. 
The website is allowing users to discover recommended places near their current location. The content is coded using the MEAN stack. They are perfect solutions to build a location based app which has important modules such as user review, rating, distance calculation, contact, etc. 

Project overview and goals

My aim is to develop tourist and travel web site that will serve as a guide for tourists visiting Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
We will develop a simple web site featuring Hotels, Restaurants, Shopping and Parks and appropriate information about their location and any contact data available. Web site will have login page and registration of new user page. In addition, there will be maps showing location of objects on the map and the users will be able to mark the places they liked and add them to their favourites list enabeling them to find them faster afterwards. The user that are owners of some hotels or restaurants will be able to add their places to the website and allow other users to see them, as well as update and delete them.

Project Scope and Objectives

A travel website is a website on the world wide web that is dedicated to travel. The site is focused on travel reviews, trip fares, or a combination of both. This web site is focused on Bosnia and Herzegovina and aims tourists visiting attractions there. Many websites take the form of a digital version of a traditional guide book, aiming to provide advice on which destinations, attractions, accommodations, and so on, are worth a visit and providing information on how to access them.
Most states, provinces and countries have their own convention and visitor bureaus, which usually sponsor a website dedicated to promoting tourism in their respective regions. Cities that rely on tourism also operate websites promoting their destinations
